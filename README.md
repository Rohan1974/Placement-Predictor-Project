# Placement-Predictor-Project
This research aims to develop a model that predicts student placement status based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) and IQ score. 
We will use several modules from the scikit-learn package to help with data preparation, scalability, and modeling, with logistic regression as the technique of choice.

AIM:

The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict whether a student will be placed in a job or not, based on their CGPA and IQ score. 
This model can be useful for both students and educational institutions to understand the factors that influence placement outcomes.

Overview:

In this project, we will:

Prepare the dataset.
Perform data preprocessing.
Build a logistic regression model.
Visualize the data to gain insights.

Libraries Used:

scikit-learn
pandas
matplotlib
numpy

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical step in preparing the data for modeling. It may include tasks such as:

Handling missing values.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Ensure you preprocess the data before moving to the model building step.

Model Building
In this project, we're utilizing logistic regression for binary classification, which is a good approach for predicting placement status. 
You may build and train the model with scikit-learn's LogisticRegression class.

Visualization
Data visualization can assist you in understanding the dataset and model performance. You may construct graphs and charts to illustrate using libraries such as Matplotlib:

CGPA and IQ scatter plots with placement status.
